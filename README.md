<li>All your files should end with a new line</ul>
<li>The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3</ul>
<li>A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory</ul>
<li>Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)</ul>
<li>All your files must be executable</ul>
<li>The length of your files will be tested using wc</ul>
<li>All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')</ul>
<li>All your classes should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')</ul>
<li>All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')</ul>
<li>A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)</ul></ol>

<h2>Python Unit Tests</h2>
<ol>
<li>Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs</ul>
<li>All your files should end with a new line</ul>
<li>All your test files should be inside a folder tests</ul>
<li>You have to use the unittest module</ul>
<li>All your test files should be python files (extension: .py)</ul>
<li>All your test files and folders should start by test_</ul>
<li>Your file organization in the tests folder should be the same as your project</ul>
e.g., For models/base_model.py, unit tests must be in: tests/test_models/test_base_model.py
e.g., For models/user.py, unit tests must be in: tests/test_models/test_user.py
<li>All your tests should be executed by using this command: python3 -m unittest discover tests</ul>
<li>You can also test file by file by using this command: python3 -m unittest tests/test_models/test_base_model.py</ul>
<li>All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')</ul>
<li>All your classes should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')</ul>
<li>All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don’t miss any edge case</ul><ol>
